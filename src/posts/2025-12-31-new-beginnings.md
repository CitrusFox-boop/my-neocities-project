So, this is my first blog post! Its kinda funny to finally have my own site and blog. I've always wanted one since the early 2000s. Its funny years later I came full circle. 

The web is so different then it was when I was younger. The internet has been transformed into a giant casino. Social media sites are the slot machines where the currency is your time and energy. I don't want anything to do with it anymore. I created this site so I can have my own corner of the internet thats safe from the hostile practices of microblogging and out of touch billionaires.

As the new year rolls around I want to invite you to my little pocket of the void. We don't have to play someone elses game anymore. 

So heres to the future! I hope we can all have fun totogether. 💖
